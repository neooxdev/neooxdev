# Hi there 👋 , want to know more? [about me](https://axcec.github.io/ace/)

Currently, I am learning more about distributed systems and infra.
In my free time, I like to build. Here are a few of my favorite open-source projects that I built from scratch:
- [Nodejs-binding-project](https://github.com/): nodeJS Bindings 
- [parser-project](https://github.com/): A parser 
- [Neon](https://github.com/): HLS streaming platform with adaptive quality and multi-bitrate transcoding
- [Navi](https://github.com,): A Go CLI tool to manage and navigate directories quickly.
