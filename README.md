# Hi there 👋 , want to know more? [about me](https://axcec.github.io/ace/)

Currently, I am learning more about distributed systems and infra.
In my free time, I like to build. Here are a few things i'm planning to build in next few months:

- [Navi](https://github.com,): A Go CLI tool to manage and navigate directories quickly.
- [gossip-cache](https://github.com/axcec/gossip-cache): Distributed buffer-cache for Go services (128GB → 2.1GB) 
- [cognitrace](https://github.com/axcec/cognitrace): AI agent memory leak scanner (LangChain/CrewAI → 92% RAM saved)
- [voice-distill](https://github.com/axcec/voice-distill): Edge Whisper gossip swarm (100 phones → MoE transcription) 
- [sql-ast-parser](https://github.com/axcec/sql-ast-parser): Java SQL AST parser (128GB Cartesian → 2GB queries)
- [lexer-go](https://github.com/axcec/lexer-go): Universal Go lexer (Docker/SQL/YAML → tokens → parsers)
- [go-vllm](https://github.com/axcec/go-vllm): Native Go bindings for vLLM (10x faster LLM serving)
